            cost and render the information of doctors whose
            average cost of services is less than or equal to the value a user inputs using the budget slider.

                Lizard</a></h3>
        <p>
            When we had Rock, Paper, Scissors as a homework assignment, I thought about how a player's choice could be
            made
            with out typing in the choice or clicking a button. Well, I was not sure if using a web cam for an input in
            python ever existed, but I thought that would be a great option. And when our final project assignments were
            released, I was sure I wanted to explore how I would be able to achieve the use of a web cam to play rock,
            paper, scissors, spock,lizard. This was the motivation for me to choose this project.
