        <h2>My TNT experience</h2>
        <p>The TNT program is a seven-week innovation academy that enables first and second year college
            students experience the product lifecycle with involvement in both the PM and Engineering
            curriculum.
            Unlike previous years where the major technology learned was Swift for iOS
            application development,in 2020 was a fully remote program that taught web development with ReactJS and
            Typescript
            in addition to a Project management curriculum.
            Although I missed the in-person experince due to the Covid-19 pandemic, I learned so much from the
            internship! :)

        <h4>Project overview</h4>
        <p>
            Developed a web application to provide health care information to young adults in a team of five interns
            (shout out to the Bill Gates Fun Club! Rachel, Ian, Carlos,Denis)

        <h4>My contribution</h4>
        I implemented the budget filtering feature in our application that enabled a user filter doctors based on their
        cost and render the information of doctors whose
        average cost of services is less than or equal to the value a user inputs using the budget slider.

        To implement this feature, I used React redux which enabled global state management of a list of
        doctor objects in our React applicationâ€™s store. Each doctor is an object of the doctor class that
        takes in information like name, specialty, location, services offered, years in practice, and others.

        To enable real-time update of a filtered doctor list which is also a list of doctors objects, I created
        React redux method to filter and append all doctors whose average cost is less than or equal to
        the budget slider value to a filtered list also stored in our redux store. Since this filtered list is
        stored in the Redux store, then the list was globally accessible and enabled real time update of
        doctor information in our application as the user moved the budget slider.
